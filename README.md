Designed with full customization options, it seamlessly integrates with your Discord application and allows you to tailor it with your own set of questions. Best of all, it's completely free to use! Add your own unique twist to enhance your community's experience. 

This bot was created with the sole purpose of assisting communities in need of an effective and adaptable whitelist system. 

Give it a try and improve your community!
